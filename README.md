# The Sensorium Project

**Affective Computation, Haptic Sensing, and Dance**

A practice-led research initiative exploring how bodies feel together through soft robotics, wearable sensors, and live performance.

## About

The Sensorium Project treats the dancing body as both instrument and sensor array. Working with soft fluidic pressure sensors, micro-vibration elements, and wearable interfaces, we ask how movement, pressure, and touch can be translated into light, sound, and texture without flattening the complexity of feeling.

**Central Question:** *What happens when a dancing body, soft robotics, and fluidic sensors begin to think and feel together?*

## Project Phases

### Phase 01: Me Duniya ✓
Live performance with a single performer wearing a soft fluidic sleeve and haptic devices. Signals flow into a custom pipeline translating pressure and motion into shifting light, projections, and modulated soundscapes.

### Phase 02: Haptic Installation Environment (In Development)
A space where multiple bodies—including multi-abled participants—can co-create and feel shared affective landscapes through haptic floors, wearable bands, and shared affect channels.

## The ACCS System

**Affective-Computational Choreography System** — three interacting layers:

| Layer | Function |
|-------|----------|
| **Hardware** | Soft fluidic pressure sensors, micro-vibration elements, wearable rings |
| **Signal Processing** | Transforms raw signals into intensity, stability, fluctuation features |
| **Affective Atmosphere** | Drives visual/sonic environment — light, projections, spatial audio |
